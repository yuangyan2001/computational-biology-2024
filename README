gentest*.sh: generating the sbatch script for running the job
runtest*.sh: submitting the job once in a row


Experiment platform
details could be found here: https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Narval/en
For the jobs we are running, our job are run on the first configuration of the nodes mwntioned above, requested exclusive resource and all the available memory(249GB)

Experiment overview
Our experiments has three parts.
Part A: The proformace degradtion of database on remote nodes
    When the database resides on a remote storage node, a single query of 160bp takes over 50 minutes to complete, compared to 5 minutes when the database is copied to the local SSD.
Part B: Program running indicators and analysis of single threaded mode
Part C: Program running indicators and analysis of multithreades mode, compared two multithreading methods(database split and query split)

Profiling tool:
Linux perf
